# Genz's Career Aspiration Project

## Overview
This project documents my journey towards understanding career aspirations within the Gen Z demographic. Starting with manual data collection from online forums, I curated valuable insights related to career preferences, challenges, and goals.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered information from Gen Z individuals across various platforms (forums, social media, etc.).
   - Captured their thoughts on career paths, industries, and desired skills.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Standardized raw input using Excel:
     - Cleaned and organized data.
     - Addressed inconsistencies and missing values.

3. **SQL Queries and Manipulation:**
   - Leveraged SQL to extract meaningful insights:
     - Explored trends in career interests.
     - Analyzed factors influencing career choices.

4. **Visualization and Insights:**
   - Utilized Power BI and Excel dashboards:
     - Visualized career-related patterns.
     - Highlighted emerging trends and challenges.

## Goals:
- Understand Gen Z's career preferences.
- Provide actionable insights for educators, employers, and policymakers.
